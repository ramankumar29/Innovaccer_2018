Installation Prerequisites

I have written my python code in jupytor Ipython notebook. So for that one should have Anaconda distribution installed.This is because these distributions come packaged with all the supplementary libraries needed and these have been historically difficult to install separately.
Anaconda Python from http://continuum.io


Libraries name Pandas, sklearn and Editdistance are used in the code. So make sure that you have installed the same.


one can install these libraries with simple commands in command prompt as follows:

pip install edit_distance for Editdistance

pip install -U scikit-learn for Sciket-learn

pip install pandas for pandas
